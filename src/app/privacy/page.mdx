## 1. Who we are

- Hemlock's Gray Matter (“we,” “us,” or “our”)
- Website: frc5712.com - https://ctre-workshop-site.vercel.app
- Contact: graymatter@hemlockps.com | 700 N Pine St, Hemlock, MI, 48626, USA

## 2. Scope

This policy explains what data we collect when you use ctre-workshop-site.vercel.app, how we use it, how we share it, and the choices you have. Our audience is primarily in the United States, including FRC teams, with occasional international visitors.

## 3. What we collect

- Server logs (essential): IP address, user agent, pages visited, timestamp, referrer, and basic error/performance data. Used for security, reliability, and abuse prevention.

- Analytics (PostHog, anonymized/aggregated): Page views, events, device/browser context, approximate location (city/region if available), and usage metrics. We configure PostHog with user-identifying features disabled. We do not use analytics to identify or profile individuals.

- Optional anonymous surveys (PostHog): If we run surveys, responses are collected without names, emails, or other direct identifiers. We avoid sensitive questions and aggregate results.

We do not collect names, emails, payment details, or precise location. We do not have a contact form.

## 4. Cookies and similar technologies

- We use a minimal analytics cookie (PostHog) to understand site usage and improve the site.

- We disable user-identifying features (e.g., user IDs, cross-site tracking, device fingerprinting). Where available, we anonymize IPs or avoid storing them long term.

- You can reject analytics cookies via our banner, the preferences section at the top of the Privacy Policy page, or block cookies in your browser. Essential cookies (if any) are required for core functionality.

## 5. How we use information

- Operate, secure, and maintain the website.
- Monitor performance, debug issues, and prevent abuse.
- Generate aggregated, non-identifying statistics to improve content and usability.

We do not use data for targeted advertising or user profiling.

## 6. Sharing and disclosures

We do not sell or share personal information as those terms are defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA).

We may disclose information to:

- Service providers: PostHog (analytics), hosting/CDN/DDoS, and error/performance monitoring. These providers process data on our behalf under contracts.
- Legal/security: If required by law, or to protect our rights, users, or the public.

## 7. Children and students

Our site is for a general audience that may include teens involved in FRC. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information, contact us and we will delete it.

## 8. Your choices and controls

- Cookies/analytics: Use the cookie banner to accept or reject analytics. You can also block cookies in your browser.
- Do Not Track: We do not respond to DNT signals due to a lack of standardization.
- Access/deletion: If you believe we hold personal information about you (e.g., via an inadvertent submission), email us at graymatter@hemlockps.com to request access or deletion. We may need to verify your request.

California residents: We honor applicable rights under the CCPA/CPRA (access, correction, deletion, non-discrimination). We do not sell or share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.

## 9. Data retention

- Server logs: retained for 30 days for security and troubleshooting, then deleted or anonymized.
- Analytics (PostHog): retained for 1 year, aggregated where possible, then deleted or further anonymized.
- Anonymous survey responses (PostHog): retained for up to 1 year alongside analytics data, then aggregated or deleted.

## 10. Security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards (e.g., HTTPS/TLS, access controls, least-privilege, audit logging). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 11. International visitors

Our services are based in the United States (PostHog Cloud US). If you access the site from outside the US, your information may be processed in the US, which may have different data protection laws than your country.

## 12. Third parties and links

We may link to third-party sites or services. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies. We encourage you to review them. We use embedded YouTube videos, which may collect information with their own cookies or trackers.

## 13. Changes to this policy

We may update this policy periodically. We will update the “Last updated” date above and, if changes are material, provide additional notice (e.g., on-site banner).
