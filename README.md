# Gray Matter Coding Workshop Website

🌐 **Live Site: [ctre-workshop-site.vercel.app](https://ctre-workshop-site.vercel.app)**

A responsive website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS that converts the Gray Matter Coding Workshop Canva presentation into an accessible markdown-based learning platform.

## 🎯 About

This website transforms the FRC programming workshop content into an interactive web experience, covering:

- **Introduction & Prerequisites** - Getting started with FRC programming
- **Hardware Setup** - CTRE motors, CANivore, and device configuration
- **Project Setup** - Creating and organizing WPILib projects
- **Command-Based Framework** - Understanding triggers, subsystems, and commands
- **Control Systems** - PID and Feedforward control theory
- **Tuning** - Real-world mechanism tuning with Phoenix Tuner X

## 🔗 Workshop Code Repository

The workshop includes live code examples from the companion repository:
**[Workshop-Code](https://github.com/Hemlock5712/Workshop-Code)**

### Implementation Progression

The workshop follows a structured 5-step progression:

1. **Step 1: Creating a Subsystem** - Basic motor control and sensor integration
2. **Step 2: Adding Commands** - Command-based architecture and user input
3. **Step 3: PID Control** - Precise position control with feedback loops
4. **Step 4: Using Motion Magic** - Smooth profiled movements with acceleration control
5. **Step 5: Useful Subsystem Functions** - Safety features, utilities, and diagnostics

Each step builds upon the previous implementation, showing real-world development practices.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Optional: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1+ for alternative package management

Project uses **pnpm** by default, but npm/yarn/bun work interchangeably.

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Development Commands

- `pnpm dev` – start the local development server with Turbopack
- `pnpm build` – build for production (includes search generation and formatting)
- `pnpm start` – start the production server
- `pnpm lint` – lint code with ESLint
- `pnpm type-check` – check TypeScript types
- `pnpm format` – format code with Prettier
- `pnpm format:check` – check code formatting without writing
- `pnpm generate-search` – update search index data
- `pnpm spell` – run spell check on TypeScript and markdown files
- `pnpm test` – run full test suite (format:check + lint + type-check + build)

**Note:** You can substitute `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun` for `pnpm` in any command.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15.4.6 with App Router
- **UI Library:** React 19.1.0
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
